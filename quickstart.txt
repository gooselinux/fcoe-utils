CONFIGURE AN FCOE INTERFACE
First, ensure that the open-fcoe and dcbd packages are installed.

This example sets up a VLAN (101) for Ethernet interface eth3 and configures
the system to automatically connect to storage over this interface.

1) Create a VLAN (specifics may vary by distribution)
   # cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
   # cp ifcfg-eth3 ifcfg-eth3.101
   # edit ifcfg-eth3.101 and ensure it contains the following:

   DEVICE=eth3.101
   VLAN=yes
   ONBOOT=yes

2) Configure FCoE for the VLAN
   # cd /etc/fcoe/
   # cp cfg-ethx cfg-eth3.101

3) Start dcbd and configure the Ethernet interface
   # /etc/init.d/dcbd start
   # dcbtool sc eth3 dcb on
   # dcbtool sc eth3 app:fcoe e:1

   Note:  the above assumes no other changes have been made to the DCB
   settings for the Ethernet interface.

4) Start FCoE
   # /etc/init.d/fcoe start
     After a few moments your storage should apear (assuming everything is
     configured correctly on the fabric)

5) Setup dcbd and fcoe to start when booting
    # chkconfig dcbd on
    # chkconfig fcoe on
